# Getting Started with Create React App


In the project directory, you can run using the following command:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

`npm run build`

Building the app for production is a breeze. Hereâ€™s what happens:

Optimized for Performance: React is bundled in production mode, ensuring top-notch performance.
Minified and Hashed: Your build is minified, and filenames are hashed for efficient caching and retrieval.
Deployment-Ready: The final product is neatly placed in the build folder, ready for deployment.
Your app is now primed and ready to dazzle your users!
